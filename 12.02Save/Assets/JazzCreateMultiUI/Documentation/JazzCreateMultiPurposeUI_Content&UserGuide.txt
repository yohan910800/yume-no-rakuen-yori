                                                    (MainAsset)
1, 1 x UI/Sprite sheet dimensions 2048 x 2048px, each UI dimensions 128 x 128px made up of 8 x 8px pixels
      sliced by cell size = 128 x 128px which makes the 256 UI(Images)/Sprites.

2, 1 x Demo Scene - shows examples of Some UI images and Sprites made with some of the contents in this package
3, MenuCanvas Prefab + trafficLights,XmasTree,SnowMan,TitlePanel,JoyPad,House,XmasPresent,Car + Play Button
   HudCanvas Prefab + health heart, health fill
   Player Prefab
   Enemy Prefab 
   Bullet Prefab
   Enemy Launcher Prefab
   MainCamera & EventSystem prefabs( required for scene to display and for UI functionality to work).
4, (5 example Scripts)
      1) to set up scene and start game.
      2) New - now uses simple animation for ufo lights(replaced IEnumerator from script)
         New, now enemies are pool, so no more destroy objects (better performance)
      3)  control for Player and Shooting + collision detection and health heart control, clamp player to screen.
          New - player scripts seperated health, move, shoot - for easier understanding and extendability.
          *player bullets are now pooled
      4) spawn(Invoke) enemies in a random place in a range across top of screen by a repeat and delay time,
         *from the new pooled enemies
      5) control bullet collision and set time until bullet destroys itself if nothing is hit
         (to avoid build up of bullets in hierarchy).
5, 63 UI image prefabs ready to use, a few with animations for example. (easier to use can just change colors to liking)

UserGuide 

Import settings for  JazzCreateUI_SpritesNewEdited Texture type = Sprite(2D and UI)
                                                          Sprite Mode = Multiple
                                                          Packing Tag = 
                                                          Pixels Per Unit = 100 
                                                          Max Size = 2048 (this is the actual size)
To complete setup click Sprite Editor, in editor window click slice at top left then change Type - Grid by Cell size
and change the Pixel Size to X 128 Y 128. Click slice then Apply (UI/Sprites ready to use).

each individual UI/Sprites can be scaled e.g. 128x128px, 64x64px, 32x32px, 16x16px, 8x8px to keep best pixel scales
and for UI&Sprite combinations.

This pack is design to give a wide variety of UI(Images or Sprites)
which have assosiated UI(Images)/Sprites to build multi coloured UI(Images) or Sprites.

See what you can create, get ideas and examples from the demo scene included showing how multi color UI(Images)
are put together, and some animations examples altering colours of enemy sprite/and UI's, button to start 2D shooter game,
health heart example.

Hints

a, when adding new Image to UI canvas, after choosing the UI image from the sprite sheet and populating
   click set to native size(which is 128px x 128px).
b, if making multicolour child the next UI image to the first, populate from sprite sheet and click native size
  this will then correct sizing to match first image and so on
c, Sometimes adjustments may be needed in hierarchy if an image is suppose to be on top of another,
   simply drag object above of below in Hierarchy.(see next tip)
d, sometimes its good practice to change colour of UI(Image) or sprite as building layers of a multi-colour 
   UI(image) or Sprite to help with getting them in correct order of Hierarchy.
